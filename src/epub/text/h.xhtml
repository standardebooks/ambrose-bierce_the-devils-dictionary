					<dfn>Hades</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The lower world; the residence of departed spirits; the place where the dead live.</p>
					<p>Among the ancients the idea of Hades was not synonymous with our Hell, many of the most respectable men of antiquity residing there in a very comfortable kind of way. Indeed, the Elysian Fields themselves were a part of Hades, though they have since been removed to Paris. When the Jacobean version of the New Testament was in process of evolution the pious and learned men engaged in the work insisted by a majority vote on translating the Greek word “<i xml:lang="gr">ᾍδης</i>” as “Hell”; but a conscientious minority member secretly possessed himself of the record and struck out the objectional word wherever he could find it. At the next meeting, the Bishop of Salisbury, looking over the work, suddenly sprang to his feet and said with considerable excitement: “Gentlemen, somebody has been razing ‘Hell’ here!” Years afterward the good prelate’s death was made sweet by the reflection that he had been the means (under Providence) of making an important, serviceable and immortal addition to the phraseology of the English tongue.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Hag</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>An elderly lady whom you do not happen to like; sometimes called, also, a hen, or cat. Old witches, sorceresses, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, were called hags from the belief that their heads were surrounded by a kind of baleful lumination or nimbus⁠—hag being the popular name of that peculiar electrical light sometimes observed in the hair. At one time hag was not a word of reproach: Drayton speaks of a “beautiful hag, all smiles,” much as Shakespeare said, “sweet wench.” It would not now be proper to call your sweetheart a hag⁠—that compliment is reserved for the use of her grandchildren.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Half</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>One of two equal parts into which a thing may be divided, or considered as divided. In the fourteenth century a heated discussion arose among theologists and philosophers as to whether Omniscience could part an object into three halves; and the pious Father Aldrovinus publicly prayed in the cathedral at Rouen that God would demonstrate the affirmative of the proposition in some signal and unmistakable way, and particularly (if it should please Him) upon the body of that hardy blasphemer, Manutius Procinus, who maintained the negative. Procinus, however, was spared to die of the bite of a viper.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Halo</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Properly, a luminous ring encircling an astronomical body, but not infrequently confounded with “aureola,” or “nimbus,” a somewhat similar phenomenon worn as a headdress by divinities and saints. The halo is a purely optical illusion, produced by moisture in the air, in the manner of a rainbow; but the aureola is conferred as a sign of superior sanctity, in the same way as a bishop’s mitre, or the Pope’s tiara. In the painting of the Nativity, by Szedgkin, a pious artist of Pesth, not only do the Virgin and the Child wear the nimbus, but an ass nibbling hay from the sacred manger is similarly decorated and, to his lasting honor be it said, appears to bear his unaccustomed dignity with a truly saintly grace.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Hand</dfn>

				<dd>
					<p>A singular instrument worn at the end of the human arm and commonly thrust into somebody’s pocket.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Handkerchief</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A small square of silk or linen, used in various ignoble offices about the face and especially serviceable at funerals to conceal the lack of tears. The handkerchief is of recent invention; our ancestors knew nothing of it and entrusted its duties to the sleeve. Shakespeare’s introducing it into the play of “Othello” is an anachronism: Desdemona dried her nose with her skirt, as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mary Walker and other reformers have done with their coattails in our own day⁠—an evidence that revolutions sometimes go backward.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Hangman</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>An officer of the law charged with duties of the highest dignity and utmost gravity, and held in hereditary disesteem by a populace having a criminal ancestry. In some of the American States his functions are now performed by an electrician, as in New Jersey, where executions by electricity have recently been ordered⁠—the first instance known to this lexicographer of anybody questioning the expediency of hanging Jerseymen.</p>

						<p>
							<span>In ancient times there lived a king</span>

							<br/>
							<span>From all his subjects gold enough</span>
							<br/>
							<span>To make the royal way less rough.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>For pleasure’s highway, like the dames</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Whose premises adjoin it, claims</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Perpetual repairing. So</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The tax-collectors in a row</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Appeared before the throne to pray</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Their master to devise some way</span>
							<br/>
							<span>To swell the revenue. “So great,”</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Said they, “are the demands of state</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A tithe of all that we collect</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Will scarcely meet them. Pray reflect:</span>
							<br/>
							<span>How, if one-tenth we must resign,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Can we exist on t’other nine?”</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The monarch asked them in reply:</span>
							<br/>
							<span>“Has it occurred to you to try</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The advantage of economy?”</span>
							<br/>
							<span>“It has,” the spokesman said: “we sold</span>
							<br/>
							<span>All of our gay garrotes of gold;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>With plated-ware we now compress</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The necks of those whom we assess.</span>

							<br/>
							<span>That which your Majesty requires.”</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Deep lines of thought were seen to plow</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Their way across the royal brow.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>“Your state is desperate, no question;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Pray favor me with a suggestion.”</span>
							<br/>
							<span>“O King of Men,” the spokesman said,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>“If you’ll impose upon each head</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A tax, the augmented revenue</span>
							<br/>
							<span>We’ll cheerfully divide with you.”</span>
							<br/>
							<span>As flashes of the sun illume</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The parted storm-cloud’s sullen gloom,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The king smiled grimly. “I decree</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That it be so⁠—and, not to be</span>
							<br/>
							<span>In generosity outdone,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Declare you, each and every one,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Exempted from the operation</span>

							<br/>
							<span>The monarch from the throne-room walked</span>

					<p>An automatic, muscular blood-pump. Figuratively, this useful organ is said to be the seat of emotions and sentiments⁠—a very pretty fancy which, however, is nothing but a survival of a once universal belief. It is now known that the sentiments and emotions reside in the stomach, being evolved from food by chemical action of the gastric fluid. The exact process by which a beefsteak becomes a feeling⁠—tender or not, according to the age of the animal from which it was cut; the successive stages of elaboration through which a caviar sandwich is transmuted to a quaint fancy and reappears as a pungent epigram; the marvelous functional methods of converting a hard-boiled egg into religious contrition, or a cream-puff into a sigh of sensibility⁠—these things have been patiently ascertained by <abbr class="name">M.</abbr> Pasteur, and by him expounded with convincing lucidity. (See, also, my monograph, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Essential Identity of the Spiritual Affections and Certain Intestinal Gases Freed in Digestion</i>⁠—4to, 687 pp.) In a scientific work entitled, I believe, <i xml:lang="la">Delectatio Demonorum</i> (John Camden Hotton, London, 1873) this view of the sentiments receives a striking illustration; and for further light consult Professor Dam’s famous treatise on “Love as a Product of Alimentary Maceration.”</p>

					<p>To pass the winter season in domestic seclusion. There have been many singular popular notions about the hibernation of various animals. Many believe that the bear hibernates during the whole winter and subsists by mechanically sucking its paws. It is admitted that it comes out of its retirement in the spring so lean that it had to try twice before it can cast a shadow. Three or four centuries ago, in England, no fact was better attested than that swallows passed the winter months in the mud at the bottom of their brooks, clinging together in globular masses. They have apparently been compelled to give up the custom on account of the foulness of the brooks. Sotus Escobius discovered in Central Asia a whole nation of people who hibernate. By some investigators, the fasting of Lent is supposed to have been originally a modified form of hibernation, to which the Church gave a religious significance; but this view was strenuously opposed by that eminent authority, Bishop Kip, who did not wish any honors denied to the memory of the Founder of his family.</p>
