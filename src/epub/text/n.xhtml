					<p>A drink served at banquets of the Olympian deities. The secret of its preparation is lost, but the modern Kentuckians believe that they come pretty near to a knowledge of its chief ingredient.</p>

					<p>The <i xml:lang="fr">pièce de résistance</i> in the American political problem. Representing him by the letter <var>n</var>, the Republicans begin to build their equation thus: “Let <var>n</var> = the white man.” This, however, appears to give an unsatisfactory solution.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Nose</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The extreme outpost of the face. From the circumstance that great conquerors have great noses, Getius, whose writings antedate the age of humor, calls the nose the organ of quell. It has been observed that one’s nose is never so happy as when thrust into the affairs of another, from which some physiologists have drawn the inference that the nose is devoid of the sense of smell.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Notoriety</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The fame of one’s competitor for public honors. The kind of renown most accessible and acceptable to mediocrity. A Jacob’s-ladder leading to the vaudeville stage, with angels ascending and descending.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Noumenon</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>That which exists, as distinguished from that which merely seems to exist, the latter being a phenomenon. The noumenon is a bit difficult to locate; it can be apprehended only be a process of reasoning⁠—which is a phenomenon. Nevertheless, the discovery and exposition of noumena offer a rich field for what Lewes calls “the endless variety and excitement of philosophic thought.” Hurrah (therefore) for the noumenon!</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Novel</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A short story padded. A species of composition bearing the same relation to literature that the panorama bears to art. As it is too long to be read at a sitting the impressions made by its successive parts are successively effaced, as in the panorama. Unity, totality of effect, is impossible; for besides the few pages last read all that is carried in mind is the mere plot of what has gone before. To the romance the novel is what photography is to painting. Its distinguishing principle, probability, corresponds to the literal actuality of the photograph and puts it distinctly into the category of reporting; whereas the free wing of the romancer enables him to mount to such altitudes of imagination as he may be fitted to attain; and the first three essentials of the literary art are imagination, imagination and imagination. The art of writing novels, such as it was, is long dead everywhere except in Russia, where it is new. Peace to its ashes⁠—some of which have a large sale.</p>
