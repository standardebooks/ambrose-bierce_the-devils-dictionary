							<span class="i1">For the friar got hold of its tail,</span>

						<p>In this small fish I take it that human wisdom is admirably figured and symbolized; for whereas the crayfish doth move only backward, and can have only retrospection, seeing naught but the perils already passed, so the wisdom of man doth not enable him to avoid the follies that beset his course, but only to apprehend their nature afterward.</p>

					<dfn>Cross</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>An ancient religious symbol erroneously supposed to owe its significance to the most solemn event in the history of Christianity, but really antedating it by thousands of years. By many it has been believed to be identical with the <i xml:lang="la">crux ansata</i> of the ancient phallic worship, but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that, to the rites of primitive peoples. We have today the White Cross as a symbol of chastity, and the Red Cross as a badge of benevolent neutrality in war. Having in mind the former, the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape smites the lyre to the effect following:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>“Be good, be good!” the sisterhood</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Cry out in holy chorus,</span>

						<p>
							<span>But why, O why, has ne’er an eye</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Seen her of winsome manner</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And youthful grace and pretty face</span>

							<br/>
							<span class="i1">To better our behaving?</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A simpler plan for saving man</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">(But, first, is he worth saving?)</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Is, dears, when he declines to flee</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">From bad thoughts that beset him,</span>
							<br/>

The notion of symbolizing sexual love by a semisexless babe, and comparing the pains of passion to the wounds of an arrow⁠—of introducing this pudgy homunculus into art grossly to materialize the subtle spirit and suggestion of the work⁠—this is eminently worthy of the age that, giving it birth, laid it on the doorstep of posterity.</p>
