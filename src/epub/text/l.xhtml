				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A part of the earth’s surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the superstructure. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of <i xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.</p>

					<p>An interior convulsion, producing a distortion of the features and accompanied by inarticulate noises. It is infectious and, though intermittent, incurable. Liability to attacks of laughter is one of the characteristics distinguishing man from the animals⁠—these being not only inaccessible to the provocation of his example, but impregnable to the microbes having original jurisdiction in bestowal of the disease. Whether laughter could be imparted to animals by inoculation from the human patient is a question that has not been answered by experimentation. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Meir Witchell holds that the infectious character of laughter is due to the instantaneous fermentation of <i xml:lang="la">sputa</i> diffused in a spray.

					<dfn>Lexicographer</dfn>

				<dd>
					<p>A pestilent fellow who, under the pretense of recording some particular stage in the development of a language, does what he can to arrest its growth, stiffen its flexibility and mechanize its methods. For your lexicographer, having written his dictionary, comes to be considered “as one having authority,” whereas his function is only to make a record, not to give a law. The natural servility of the human understanding having invested him with judicial power, surrenders its right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statute. Let the dictionary (for example) mark a good word as “obsolete” or “obsolescent” and few men thereafter venture to use it, whatever their need of it and however desirable its restoration to favor⁠—whereby the process of impoverishment is accelerated and speech decays. On the contrary, the bold and discerning writer who, recognizing the truth that language must grow by innovation if it grow at all, makes new words and uses the old in an unfamiliar sense, has no following and is tartly reminded that “it isn’t in the dictionary”⁠—although down to the time of the first lexicographer (Heaven forgive him!) no author ever had used a word that <em>was</em> in the dictionary. In the golden prime and high noon of English speech; when from the lips of the great Elizabethans fell words that made their own meaning and carried it in their very sound; when a Shakespeare and a Bacon were possible, and the language now rapidly perishing at one end and slowly renewed at the other was in vigorous growth and hardy preservation⁠—sweeter than honey and stronger than a lion⁠—the lexicographer was a person unknown, the dictionary a creation which his Creator had not created him to create.</p>

					<p>The King of Manchuria had a magic looking-glass, whereon whoso looked saw, not his own image, but only that of the king. A certain courtier who had long enjoyed the king’s favor and was thereby enriched beyond any other subject of the realm, said to the king: “Give me, I pray, thy wonderful mirror, so that when absent out of thine august presence I may yet do homage before thy visible shadow, prostrating myself night and morning in the glory of thy benign countenance, as which nothing has so divine splendor, O Noonday Sun of the Universe!”</p>
					<p>Pleased with the speech, the king commanded that the mirror be conveyed to the courtier’s palace; but after, having gone thither without apprisal, he found it in an apartment where was naught but idle lumber. And the mirror was dimmed with dust and overlaced with cobwebs. This so angered him that he fisted it hard, shattering the glass, and was sorely hurt. Enraged all the more by this mischance, he commanded that the ungrateful courtier be thrown into prison, and that the glass be repaired and taken back to his own palace; and this was done. But when the king looked again on the mirror he saw not his image as before, but only the figure of a crowned ass, having a bloody bandage on one of its hinder hooves⁠—as the artificers and all who had looked upon it had before discerned but feared to report. Taught wisdom and charity, the king restored his courtier to liberty, had the mirror set into the back of the throne and reigned many years with justice and humility; and one day when he fell asleep in death while on the throne, the whole court saw in the mirror the luminous figure of an angel, which remains to this day.</p>

							<br/>
							<span>Unworthy the father-in-legal care</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of that elderly sport, notwithstanding the truth</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That Cadde had renounced all the follies of youth;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>For, sad to relate, he’d arrived at the stage</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of existence that’s marked by the vices of age.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Among them, cupidity caused him to urge</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Repeated demands on the pocket of Splurge,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Till, wrecked in his fortune, that gentleman saw</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Inadequate aid in the practice of Draw,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And took, as a means of augmenting his pelf,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>To the business of being a lord himself.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>His neat-fitting garments he wilfully shed</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And sacked himself strangely in checks instead;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Denuded his chin, but retained at each ear</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A whisker that looked like a blasted career.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>He painted his neck an incarnadine hue</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Each morning and varnished it all that he knew.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The moony monocular set in his eye</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Appeared to be scanning the Sweet By-and-By.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>His head was enroofed with a billycock hat,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And his low-necked shoes were aduncous and flat.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>In speech he eschewed his American ways,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Denying his nose to the use of his <i epub:type="z3998:grapheme">A</i>’s</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And dulling their edge till the delicate sense</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of a babe at their temper could take no offence.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>His <i epub:type="z3998:grapheme">H</i>’s⁠—’twas most inexpressibly sweet,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The patter they made as they fell at his feet!</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Re-outfitted thus, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Splurge without fear</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Began as Lord Splurge his recouping career.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Alas, the Divinity shaping his end</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Entertained other views and decided to send</span>
							<br/>
							<span>His lordship in horror, despair and dismay</span>
							<br/>
							<span>From the land of the nobleman’s natural prey.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>For, smit with his Old World ways, Lady Cadde</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Fell⁠—suffering Caesar!⁠—in love with her dad!</span>

					<dfn>Lore</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Learning⁠—particularly that sort which is not derived from a regular course of instruction but comes of the reading of occult books, or by nature. This latter is commonly designated as folklore and embraces popularly myths and superstitions. In Baring-Gould’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Curious Myths of the Middle Ages</i> the reader will find many of these traced backward, through various people on converging lines, toward a common origin in remote antiquity. Among these are the fables of “Teddy the Giant Killer,” “The Sleeping John Sharp Williams,” “Little Red Riding Hood and the Sugar Trust,” “Beauty and the Brisbane,” “The Seven Aldermen of Ephesus,” “Rip Van Fairbanks,” and so forth. The fable which Goethe so affectingly relates under the title of “The Erl-King” was known two thousand years ago in Greece as “The Demos and the Infant Industry.” One of the most general and ancient of these myths is that Arabian tale of “Ali Baba and the Forty Rockefellers.”</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Loss</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Privation of that which we had, or had not. Thus, in the latter sense, it is said of a defeated candidate that he “lost his election”; and of that eminent man, the poet Gilder, that he has “lost his mind.” It is in the former and more legitimate sense, that the word is used in the famous epitaph:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>Here Huntington’s ashes long have lain</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Whose loss is our eternal gain,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>For while he exercised all his powers</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Whatever he gained, the loss was ours.</span>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Love</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of the patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder. This disease, like <i xml:lang="la">caries</i> and many other ailments, is prevalent only among civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from its ravages. It is sometimes fatal, but more frequently to the physician than to the patient.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Lunarian</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>An inhabitant of the moon, as distinguished from Lunatic, one whom the moon inhabits. The Lunarians have been described by Lucian, Locke and other observers, but without much agreement. For example, Bragellos avers their anatomical identity with Man, but Professor Newcomb says they are more like the hill tribes of Vermont.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Lyre</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>An ancient instrument of torture. The word is now used in a figurative sense to denote the poetic faculty, as in the following fiery lines of our great poet, Ella Wheeler Wilcox:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>I sit astride Parnassus with my lyre,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And pick with care the disobedient wire.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That stupid shepherd lolling on his crook</span>
							<br/>
							<span>With deaf attention scarcely deigns to look.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>I bide my time, and it shall come at length,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>When, with a Titan’s energy and strength,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>I’ll grab a fistful of the strings, and O,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The word shall suffer when I let them go!</span>
