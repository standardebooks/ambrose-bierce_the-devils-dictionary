			<p><i epub:type="z3998:grapheme">X</i> in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility to the attacks of the spelling reformers, and like them, will doubtless last as long as the language. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> is the sacred symbol of ten dollars, and in such words as <abbr>Xmas</abbr>, <abbr>Xn</abbr>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, stands for Christ, not, as is popular supposed, because it represents a cross, but because the corresponding letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of his name⁠—<i xml:lang="el">χριστός</i>. If it represented a cross it would stand for <abbr>St.</abbr> Andrew, who “testified” upon one of that shape. In the algebra of psychology <var>x</var> stands for Woman’s mind. Words beginning with <i epub:type="z3998:grapheme">X</i> are Grecian and will not be defined in this standard English dictionary.</p>
