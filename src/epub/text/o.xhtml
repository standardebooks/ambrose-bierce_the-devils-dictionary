					<dfn>Oath</dfn>

					<p>In law, a solemn appeal to the Deity, made binding upon the conscience by a penalty for perjury.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Oblivion</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The state or condition in which the wicked cease from struggling and the dreary are at rest. Fame’s eternal dumping ground. Cold storage for high hopes. A place where ambitious authors meet their works without pride and their betters without envy. A dormitory without an alarm clock.</p>
				</dd>

					<p>A place where astronomers conjecture away the guesses of their predecessors.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="past-participle">
					<dfn>Obsessed</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Vexed by an evil spirit, like the Gadarene swine and other critics. Obsession was once more common than it is now. Arasthus tells of a peasant who was occupied by a different devil for every day in the week, and on Sundays by two. They were frequently seen, always walking in his shadow, when he had one, but were finally driven away by the village notary, a holy man; but they took the peasant with them, for he vanished utterly. A devil thrown out of a woman by the Archbishop of Rheims ran through the trees, pursued by a hundred persons, until the open country was reached, where by a leap higher than a church spire he escaped into a bird. A chaplain in Cromwell’s army exorcised a soldier’s obsessing devil by throwing the soldier into the water, when the devil came to the surface. The soldier, unfortunately, did not.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="adjective">
					<dfn>Obsolete</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>No longer used by the timid. Said chiefly of words. A word which some lexicographer has marked obsolete is ever thereafter an object of dread and loathing to the fool writer, but if it is a good word and has no exact modern equivalent equally good, it is good enough for the good writer. Indeed, a writer’s attitude toward “obsolete” words is as true a measure of his literary ability as anything except the character of his work. A dictionary of obsolete and obsolescent words would not only be singularly rich in strong and sweet parts of speech; it would add large possessions to the vocabulary of every competent writer who might not happen to be a competent reader.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="adjective">
					<dfn>Obstinate</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Inaccessible to the truth as it is manifest in the splendor and stress of our advocacy.</p>
					<p>The popular type and exponent of obstinacy is the mule, a most intelligent animal.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="adjective">
					<dfn>Occasional</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Afflicting us with greater or less frequency. That, however, is not the sense in which the word is used in the phrase “occasional verses,” which are verses written for an “occasion,” such as an anniversary, a celebration or other event. True, they afflict us a little worse than other sorts of verse, but their name has no reference to irregular recurrence.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Occident</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The part of the world lying west (or east) of the Orient. It is largely inhabited by Christians, a powerful subtribe of the Hypocrites, whose principal industries are murder and cheating, which they are pleased to call “war” and “commerce.” These, also, are the principal industries of the Orient.</p>

					<p>A body of water occupying about two-thirds of a world made for man⁠—who has no gills.</p>

				<dt class="adjective">
					<dfn>Offensive</dfn>
				</dt>

					<p>Generating disagreeable emotions or sensations, as the advance of an army against its enemy.</p>

					<dfn>Old</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>In that stage of usefulness which is not inconsistent with general inefficiency, as an <em>old man</em>. Discredited by lapse of time and offensive to the popular taste, as an <em>old</em> book.</p>

					<p>Oily, smooth, sleek.</p>
					<p>Disraeli once described the manner of Bishop Wilberforce as “unctuous, oleaginous, saponaceous.” And the good prelate was ever afterward known as Soapy Sam. For every man there is something in the vocabulary that would stick to him like a second skin. His enemies have only to find it.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Opposition</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>In politics the party that prevents the Government from running amuck by hamstringing it.</p>
					<p>The King of Ghargaroo, who had been abroad to study the science of government, appointed one hundred of his fattest subjects as members of a parliament to make laws for the collection of revenue. Forty of these he named the Party of Opposition and had his Prime Minister carefully instruct them in their duty of opposing every royal measure. Nevertheless, the first one that was submitted passed unanimously. Greatly displeased, the King vetoed it, informing the Opposition that if they did that again they would pay for their obstinacy with their heads. The entire forty promptly disemboweled themselves.</p>
					<p>“What shall we do now?” the King asked. “Liberal institutions cannot be maintained without a party of Opposition.”</p>
					<p>“Splendor of the universe,” replied the Prime Minister, “it is true these dogs of darkness have no longer their credentials, but all is not lost. Leave the matter to this worm of the dust.”</p>
					<p>So the Minister had the bodies of his Majesty’s Opposition embalmed and stuffed with straw, put back into the seats of power and nailed there. Forty votes were recorded against every bill and the nation prospered. But one day a bill imposing a tax on warts was defeated⁠—the members of the Government party had not been nailed to their seats! This so enraged the King that the Prime Minister was put to death, the parliament was dissolved with a battery of artillery, and government of the people, by the people, for the people perished from Ghargaroo.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Optimism</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The doctrine, or belief, that everything is beautiful, including what is ugly, everything good, especially the bad, and everything right that is wrong. It is held with greatest tenacity by those most accustomed to the mischance of falling into adversity, and is most acceptably expounded with the grin that apes a smile. Being a blind faith, it is inaccessible to the light of disproof⁠—an intellectual disorder, yielding to no treatment but death. It is hereditary, but fortunately not contagious.</p>

				<dt class="noun">
					<dfn>Optimist</dfn>

					<dfn>Orphan</dfn>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A living person whom death has deprived of the power of filial ingratitude⁠—a privation appealing with a particular eloquence to all that is sympathetic in human nature. When young the orphan is commonly sent to an asylum, where by careful cultivation of its rudimentary sense of locality it is taught to know its place. It is then instructed in the arts of dependence and servitude and eventually turned loose to prey upon the world as a bootblack or scullery maid.</p>

					<p>The science of spelling by the eye instead of the ear. Advocated with more heat than light by the outmates of every asylum for the insane. They have had to concede a few things since the time of Chaucer, but are none the less hot in defence of those to be conceded hereafter.</p>
